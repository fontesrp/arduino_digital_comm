Make two Arduinos communicate using their digital pins and 8b10b

One of the Arduinos will generate random date, encode it using 8b10b and send it, bit by bit, using one digital port. This will be connected to a digital port in another Arduino wich will read, decode and store/display the data.

This will be used in my graduate project (TCC): a Li-Fi network using two Arduinos.
